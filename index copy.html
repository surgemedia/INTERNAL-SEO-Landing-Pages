Surge have consistently exceeded Onsite’s expectations when it comes to delivering a finished product on time, on budget and most importantly, on message.

After playing with a toy video camera for years, Paris finally got her hands on a real one and discovered the power of telling a story through the lens and wrote, directed and edited multiple shorts films. This was when Paris discovered her passion for editing. Much like a jigsaw puzzle, she loved putting all the pieces together to make the final picture and has spent years honing this craft. While she was at university, Paris volunteered her skills and time to make promotional and educational videos for non-for-profit organisations. After completing a Bachelor Of Fine Arts (Film and Television Produciton) from the Queensland University Of Technology, Paris joined the Surge Media team for her start in the industry.
